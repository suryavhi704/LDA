## 🧠 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) - Hands-On Project
This repository showcases my hands-on implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), completed as part of an intensive session conducted by Intellipaat. The project demonstrates how LDA can be leveraged as a powerful dimensionality reduction technique to improve the performance of classification models — specifically, Logistic Regression in this case.

## 📌 What You Will Find
✅ End-to-end data preprocessing

✅ Application of LDA for dimensionality reduction

✅ Training Logistic Regression models on:

Raw data

LDA-transformed data

✅ Comparison of model accuracy to highlight the impact of LDA

## 🔍 Objective
To evaluate how LDA affects model performance by transforming the feature space to maximize class separability. The primary focus is to compare classification accuracy before and after applying LDA.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights
LDA not only reduces dimensionality but also enhances class discrimination.

Logistic Regression showed improved accuracy with LDA-filtered data compared to raw input features.

Visualization of transformed components made class separation much more interpretable.

## 🚀 Run it Yourself
Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/suryavhi704/LDA.git

Navigate to the project directory
cd lda-hands-on

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
